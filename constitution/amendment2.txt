Right to Change
This is an amendment to the FreakyLand Constitution.
All may revolt against the government if approved by governmental agencies (ex: Freaky Bureau of Investigation).
All may change the laws of FreakyLand, however, they must be approved by a new force called the Freaky Approvals Desk.
They also must have at LEAST 5 agreements. You may use PollCode to run a poll for such laws.
